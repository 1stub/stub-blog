    <h1>Ajatt burnout and college</h1>
    <p>I guess im kinda just making this blog as something that I can work on for the time being.
        I have always wanted to have some kind of blog just to track my thoughts and whatever im working on
        so I decided why not lets do it. I mainly want to use this blog as something for me to keep track 
        and document my Japanese learning. I'm in the midst of a large scale burnout right now, but just about to tackle
        the massive 1.5k+ reviews I have happily waiting in anki for myself. I will stay consistent with 
        ajatt, however I don't want to become as obsessed with jp like I used to be. I just can't see myself doing something of that manner ever again.
        6+ hours of immersion a day is terrible for ones mental state. Also I will make this blog look prettier and probably stop hosting it from github in the future,
        but for now it will suffice.
