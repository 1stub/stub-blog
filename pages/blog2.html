    <h1>Japanese is Hard.</h1>
    <p>Well it is pretty self explanatory what this blog post is about. Japanese is hard. Like really hard. 
        Japanese and learning to program will probably be the hardest things I ever do in my life. And coming
         back to immersion based learning of Japanese after so many on and off periods is not very motivating.
          I really just miss having as much free time as possible to immerse and watch whatever the fuck I want
           and read all day. But that is not the reality of the life that I live anymore. As a student Iâ€™m always
            busy and there is always something that I should be studying or working on. That is why this time around,
             In my 3rd or so return to Japanese, I am going to take an approach more focused on the process. Not focused 
             on hitting new daily immersion goals, not focused on grinding anki the hardest. But focused on consistency. 
             Being consistent is key with learning Japanese. And I would be 10 times better now at Japanese, after nearly
              2 years since I started taking it seriously, had I just been consistently hitting goals like 1 hour of reading 
              1 hour of listening a day. And anki grinding is something that I am going to be very cautious of. If anki gets 
              over 30 mins a day, something will need to change. This return to Japanese is not one where I burnout and quit 
              after a month. But it is going to slowly just become a part of my life. A long term habit. </p>
